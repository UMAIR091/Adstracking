//
// The honesty rule, and how it is enforced structurally:
//   · Every FIGURE comes from `detectSignals` / the report blocks, which
//     compute over the client's own rows. Nothing here calculates a metric.
//   · Every INTERPRETATION is a fixed editorial line keyed to the KIND of
//     pattern that was measured — not generated prose. "Clicks fell 32%" is
//     the measurement; "demand or visibility changed, worth diagnosing before
//     it compounds" is the standing meaning of a traffic drop. The mapping is
//     the same for every client, so it can never become a claim about this
//     client that the data doesn't support.
//   · Every action carries the measurement that motivated it, so a reader can
//     always trace a recommendation back to a number in the report.
//
// Priority is derived from the signal's own confidence and weight, never from
// its position in a list.
