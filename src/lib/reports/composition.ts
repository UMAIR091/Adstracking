// ad platforms and no Search Console would have been called rich; a client with
// nine months of dense Search Console data and nothing else, sparse.
//
// This counts renderable content instead. A "unit" is one thing a reader can
// actually look at: a group of KPIs, a chart with enough points to be a chart, a
// table with rows, an interpretation. Pagination follows from the count, so the
// report grows and shrinks with the data rather than with a template.
